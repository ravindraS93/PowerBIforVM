**Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify a few points:**

1. The data used for demonstration purposes is dummy data created solely for reference. It bears no relation to any actual corporate environments.
2. I'm not an expert in Power BI, but I do have some basic knowledge based on my day-to-day experience.
3. ChatGPT was used to generate the code for each task and then all this code is reviewed, modified and combined as per my requirement to attain the desired result.

Hi All,

I'm Ravi, a Cyber Security Professional with over 6 years of experience in implementing and managing cybersecurity tools. Anyone working in the IT industry, or any industry for that matter, can relate to how tedious it is to build reports every month and how crucial these reports are in showcasing the efforts being put in.

Based on my recent experience with vulnerability management, reporting has been crucial in providing insights on the following topics:
1. Displaying the current vulnerability posture of the environment
2. Tracking the inflow of new vulnerabilities
3. Measuring the rate at which vulnerabilities are being remediated
4. Identifying the major contributors to critical vulnerabilities

**NOTE**

The base data we are taking for building this dashboard is being taken from the custom report we built using python. Reference: https://github.com/ravindraS93/ExcelwithPython
